Dental Clinic Web Application

This is a frontend application built with a modern tech stack for scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Tech Stack

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, providing a robust foundation for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications.

### Styling and theming

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

#### Authentication and authorization

[AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cognito/): Used for secure user authentication, authorization, and user management, enabling seamless and scalable identity management.

#### Caching and optimization improvements

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/): Serverless functions for handling backend logic, allowing cost-efficient and scalable API operations without managing servers.

#### Caching and optimization improvements

[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest): A powerful library for data fetching, caching, and synchronization, optimizing performance by reducing unnecessary network requests.

#### State management

[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/): A state management library for predictable and efficient management of application state, simplifying complex state logic.

#### Deployment

[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/): A state management library for predictable and efficient management of application state, simplifying complex state logic.

#### Assumptions

- I chose this technology stack for its scalability, high performance, and ease of maintenance. It is widely adopted by developers, making it straightforward to understand and implement, with popular tools such as Tailwind CSS, Redux, and React Query. This ensures the code is accessible, maintainable, and well-suited for integration into your project.

#### Getting Started on building

The was build

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
